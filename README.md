Designed to generate a random password with customizable features. The password can be generated based on the user's preferred length and can include uppercase letters and/or numbers. The password is generated when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button and is displayed in a popup window. The user can also copy the generated password by clicking on it.

To create this web app, HTML and JavaScript were used. The HTML code provides the structure of the web page, while the JavaScript code handles the generation of the password and the display of the popup window. The CSS code is used to style the web page and make it visually appealing.

One approach to generating a random password is to use the Math.random() method in JavaScript. This method returns a random number between 0 and 1. To generate a random password, we can use this method to randomly select characters from a set of possible characters. For example, we can define a set of possible characters that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. We can then use the Math.random() method to randomly select characters from this set and combine them to form a password of the desired length.
